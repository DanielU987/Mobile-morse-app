# Morse App for Android

## Introduction
This is a Morse code app created using Android Studio and Kotlin programming language. The app allows users to convert text into Morse code and play it using phone vibration or flashlight. Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, such as dots and dashes.

## Features
- Text-to-Morse conversion: The app converts user-entered text into Morse code.
- Morse code playback: Users can listen to the Morse code translation through phone vibration or flashlight.
- Interactive UI: The UI provides a user-friendly interface for inputting text and playing Morse code.
- Flashlight support: If the device has a flashlight, users can choose to play Morse code using the flashlight.
